Automated Tests for Bus in a Carpark Application

* These Selenium tests are written in C# and run using Visual Studio and NUnit. Make sure the browser drivers are in the current bin 
directory or path environment variable.
* There are 8 tests, which are run in 2 browsers (Chrome and IE).
* Seven of the tests pass and one test fails (BusCantExitCarpark) due to Issue #1
